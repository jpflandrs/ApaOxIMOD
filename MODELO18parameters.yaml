#        HOW TO USE
#     ApaOxISMODEL.py
###########################
# launching the program like this :
#               python3 ApaOxISMODEL.py -m parameters.yaml output_directory

#parameters.yaml is _this file_ (any name) remember that YAML is a human-readable data serialization language where identation and white-spaces are signifiant

### Description of the usage:

#ApaOxIS [-h] [-W | -A | -T | -S | -m | -TW | -AW] i o

#positional arguments:
#  i                  the parameter file (yaml file, WARNING: structure is mandatory)
#  o                  The _directory_ that will gather the results
#
#optional arguments:
#  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
#  -W, --Water        Cross variations of δ18OWi and W/A
#  -A, --Apatite      Cross variations of δ18OAi and W/A
#  -T, --Temperature  Cross variations of T and W/A
#  -S, --Sigma        Cross variations of analytical σ and W/A
#  -m, --Model        Only one histogram for given fixed conditions
#  -TW, --TwinTW      Both variations of T and δ18OWi within 1-4 ranges of W/A : a collection of histograms
#  -AW, --TwinAW      Both variations of δ18OAi and δ18OWi within 1-4 ranges of W/A : a collection of histograms

#       BASIC USE
###########################
    # if the line contains "# !! not a parameter,  must remain unchanged  !!" => this is the description of a python dictionnary key, the program _must_ find it unchanged...
    # else you may find the indication "_parameter_" that points out something that may change, modify with the values of the parameters of your simulation
    # IMPORTANT : the numeric or text is ALWAYS separated from the ":" by _a space_ and the _struture with the white-spaces identation_ is higly significant and must remain unchanged
    # "#" correspond to annotations and explaination
    
    # There are TWO chapters in the parameters, I) is dealing with the physico-chemical model II) concern the formatting of the outputs and the computer

### CHAPTER I: MODEL PARAMETERS ###
    # Ia: PHYSICO-CHEMICAL PARAMETERS
Modelparameterdictionary :      # !! not a parameter,  must remain unchanged  !!
    modeling: True              # !! not a parameter,  must remain unchanged  !! <= this is a control to discriminate the two possible yaml files
    arraysize: 500000    #nb of Monte-Carlo simulations, an integer not less than 250,000 (exploratory), ideally over 500,000, and not more than 5,000,000. 
    # 4 parameters may be set and they may be explored by steps (T, d18OWi, d18OAi) and A/W may be constant or varying by using a range and a sub-range and the way to explore the A/W effect
    # note that 10 values for T, d18OWi and d18OAi led to 9x9x9 will generate 81 pages containing 9 histograms !
    # adding A/W variations may increase this to more than 1000 pages !
    #
    # mind the "" around words (not for numbers or boolean)
    T:      # !! not a parameter,  must remain unchanged  !!
        initialvalue: 15               #_parameter_ Temperature (C°) during the diagenesis process, positive integer

                    #ex: step=-1 : 8*-1=-8 if initialvalue=-8.0 range will be (-8, -16)

        WA_window_slices: 3 # _parameter_ in how many parts do I cut the W/A window ? from 2 to 5, this is important to limit the complexity of the outputs
                      # Note that the full range is always studied and shown in the first column of the histograms.

    figSize: 20,20 #_parameter_ w,h increase h (and possibly w) to get the good view
    userTitle: "" # _parameter_ adding an useful indication of your own
    bins: 100 # _parameter_ the number of bins for the histogram
    d18OAf_range: 13,20.1 # _parameter_ the  d18OAf scale, ealways try with a large range like 12-22 and then focuse...
    
    # IIb: THE COMPUTER
threadsCount: auto            # _parameter_ [currently not used] an integer, else <auto> enables the optimization of the number of threads. Note that the speed will not be decreased proportionally with the number of threads (i.e over 1/2 of the total threads) as expected with multithreading there is an optimum.  Typically on a iMacPro (2017) with 3 GHz Intel Xeon W 20 threads: the speed increases rapidly until 10 threads, then the gain in speed is low (a very slowly growing plateau)

# The output will be send to your browser as it can read the svg/pdf graphs
instructionAndBrowserPath: open FILEPATH -a safari #_parameter_ instruction for your browsed to launch automatically the rendering through the browser. FILEPATH will be change to the current path automaticaly so DO NOT CHANGE THIS <FILEPATH>
                            # in macOS:
                            #   FILEPATH open  -a safari or open FILEPATH -a safari
                            # in Unix and Linux it should be
                            #   firefox FILEPATH
                            # in window launching the chrome browser should be

                            # change accordingly
